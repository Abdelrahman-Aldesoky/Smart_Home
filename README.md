## Prerequisites

### For Proteus Simulation

1. **Install Null-modem emulator (com0com):** This software is essential for the simulation. You can download it from the [official website](^https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/^).

2. **Configure the Bluetooth module COM ports:** Use the com0com program to identify the COM ports (for example, COM5 and COM6). These should be configured in Proteus for the Bluetooth modules.

### For Real Hardware Testing

1. **Install Serial Bluetooth Terminal App:** If you are testing on real hardware, you need to install the [Serial Bluetooth Terminal app](^https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kai_morich.serial_bluetooth_terminal&hl=en_GB^) on your Android device.

2. **Use HC-05 Bluetooth module:** The HC-05 Bluetooth module is required for real hardware testing.
